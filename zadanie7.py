# Merge two dictionaries (create new one) by following these rules:
# 
#     if some key exist only in one dictionary, then merged dictionary will have list of single item as a value
#     if key exist in both of them, then merged dictionary should have list of two values
# 
# Ex:

dict1 = {'6XM': 0.03656, 'X9S': 0.5296, '40M': 0.4625, '5ZI': 0.1843, 'BY8': 0.2344, 'B96': 0.902}
dict2 = {'SBM': 0.7874, 'EC1': 0.9828, 'SDZ': 0.7338, '8XY': 0.885, 'X9S': 0.4425, '40M': 0.581}
mergedDict = {}
